3. Generate other UAPs
3.1 sPGD
- in sgd-uap-torch project
  * run run_attack.sh to generate UAPs
- in democratic project
  * run test_spgd.sh to test

3.2 LaVAn
- in

3.3 GAP

3.4 SGA
- in https://github.com/sunbing7/Stochastic-Gradient-Aggregation.git
  * run gen_sga_targeted.sh to generate and test targeted sga uap
- in democratic project
  * run test_sga.sh to test


5. Models
  * imagenet models are from pytorch
  * caltech and asl models are from soda
  * euroSAT model is trained in https://github.com/sunbing7/EuroSAT-image-classification


6. dataset
   * imagenet:
    - uncompress imagenet validation set to IMAGENET_PATH/validation/val
    - in IMAGENET_PATH/validation directory, do below:
        * copy classes.txt to IMAGENET_PATH/validation
        * run pre_process_rename.sh
        * run generate_test_index.py to generate 2000 random indexes for testing
   * cifar-10: dataset will be downloaded automatically
   * caltech: uncompress dataset to CALTECH_PATH
   * asl: uncompress dataset to ASL_PATH
   * EuroSAT: dataset will be downloaded automatically
