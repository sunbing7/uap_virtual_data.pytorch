3. Generate other UAPs
3.1 sPGD
- in sgd-uap-torch project
  * run run_attack.sh to generate UAPs
- in democratic project
  * run test_spgd.sh to test

3.2 LaVAn

3.3 GAP

3.4 SGA
- in https://github.com/sunbing7/Stochastic-Gradient-Aggregation.git
  * run gen_sga_targeted.sh to generate and test targeted sga uap
- in democratic project
  * run test_sga.sh to test


5. Models
